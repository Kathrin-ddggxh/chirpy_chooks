                <p>
                    As our products are live animals, we are unable to offer shipment via postal service or courier. <br>

                    Once your order is close to completion, you will be contacted to arrange a delivery date.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For customers located outside of the specified counties, pick-up is available during our opening hours at the
