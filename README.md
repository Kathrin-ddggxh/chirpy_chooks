# Chirpy Chooks

This a Django based (fictional!) e-commerce application which is the last of 5 required [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/) portfolio projects.

Chirpy Chooks is the online store of a small business based in the West of Ireland, specialising in live poultry. The store offers a variety of laying hens, broiler chickens and laying ducks. It also offers delivery options within a certain radius (for the sake of simplicity this is based on counties rather than actual distances) and otherwise in-store collections.
On their site, Chirpy Chooks also host a forum about all things poultry. Articles published by the business itself are posted on a regular basis, offering helpful advice about poultry keeping, interesting facts about different breeds or the latest recommendations on feeds, bedding, pest control, etc.

## Testing

### Fixed bugs

- **Placeholder for County dropdown list in checkout form**:

    Placeholder "County *" for the dropdown menu in checkout form is not displaying in muted colour.

    **Fix**:

- **"Full Name" field in checkout not auto-filled**:

    In the checkout view, the "Full Name" field remains blank in the payment form when the rest of the form is pre-populated with the user's saved informations.

    **Fix**:

- **Payment form submits without "County" field filled in**:

    In the checkout view, the "County" field of the payment should be required. However, the form submits even without filling in the field.

    **Fix**:

- **Verbose name in "Entry" model not working**:

    In forum app, the model ``Entry`` has an added Meta class to set the verbose name in the admin interface to the correct plural "Entries". The name in the admin panel however shows "Entrys".

    **Fix**:

### References/Documentation/Tutorials

**General**:

The official [Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/) was used throughout creating this project.
The skeleton of this project is based on the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/ie/) tutorial ["Boutique Ado"](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/boutique_ado_v1/tree/250e2c2b8e43cccb56b4721cd8a8bd4de6686546).

**Basket tools**:

[Django Docs on creating custom template tags](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/howto/custom-template-tags/)

**Basket items count display in navbar**:

The syntax for displaying the amount of items currently in the shopping basket was taken from this [FeelFreeToCode tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xQRJqxdgK4&ab_channel=FeelFreeToCode)

**User alerts (toasts/messages)**:

The live feedback messages to alert user actions were implemented using the [Django message framework](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/contrib/messages/) and the respective [message levels](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/contrib/messages/).

The alert pop-up frames were rendered using [Bootstrap 5 toasts](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/toasts/).
